# Learning Statstics Libraries in Python
This is the second repository containing files that are a collection of files I made while taking the Introduction to Statistics Class and I replicated what I did in class using Python Libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Pandas. The main difference from the first one is that I put what I learned in the first repository and applied it to statistical concepts. 


Naming Scheme: I use the number attached to the Portfolio to indicate which files are pulling from which data set. Example Portfolio 13 and Regression_13. Regression_13 pulls from Portfolio 13. 

Portfolio 11: F-Test Two-Sample for Variances, Confidence Interval 

Portfolio 12: Chi-Square Independence Test, Marascuilo Pairwise Comparison Procedure

Portfolio 13: ANOVA and Regression


I will also translate my notes into French eventually :)
