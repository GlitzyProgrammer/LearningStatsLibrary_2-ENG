# Learning Statstics Libraries in Python
This is the third repository containing files that are a collection of files I made while taking the Introduction to Statistics Class and I replicated what I did in class using Python Libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Pandas, and Seaborn.
 
Naming Scheme: I use the number attached to the Portfolio to indicate which files are pulling from which data set. Example Portfolio 13 and Regression_13. Regression_13 pulls from Portfolio 13.
