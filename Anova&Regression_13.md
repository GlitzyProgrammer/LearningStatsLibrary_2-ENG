## Summary of Regression Fitting and Anova Summary 
Anova Summary
I used the concepts of the Anova and the Fisher's LSD multiple comparison test to make analysis of the data in the Portfolio 13 data
Then manually calulated each part of the Anova and Fisher's LSD table and formated it into a dataframe for interpertaion in the program. Once finished I used the library "matplotlib" to make bar graphs for visual interpertation.

Regression Summary 
I used the "statsmodels" library to short hand the calutions for the Regression Summary, Anova Table Summary, and the Table of Coefficients and formatted them into dataframes.
