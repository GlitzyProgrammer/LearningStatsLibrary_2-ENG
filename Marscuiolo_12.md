## Marascuilo_12 Summary
The file focuses on demonstrating the Chi-Square concept by using a crosstabulation of the data "Winter attitudes" and "Christmas Season"
with the crosstabulation, I got the observed contingency and the expected contingency tables. Then I got the Chi-Square value by doing it manually and using the scipy.stats library to double-check it. 
Then I performed the  Marascuilo Pairwise Comparison Procedure and I interpreted the results from the Chi-Square with the independence test.
