## Summary for Boxplot Stuff
For the first file the Reaction1ms I calculated the possible range of values the Reaction 1 data can fall within. Once I did that I manually calculated the Right-tail p-value and Critical Value for F (one-tail). Then for the same file and the other two files "Reaction2ms" and "typingSpeedwpm," I did the "F-Test Two-Sample for Variances" which I put into a dataframe for interpreting the data. Once that was all complete I did a basic comparison of the alpha given to me and the p_value_right whether to reject the Null Hypothesis or not for each file. Finally, I did a box plot of each data set in each file using "matplotlib" with extra help from "matplotlib.patches" libraries.
